In this lab, you will write a CPU scheduler to schedule the processes and output the CPU Utilization, Throughput, Average Waiting Time, and Average Turnaround Time.
1.	Learn CPU scheduling algorithms: FCFS, RR
2.	Calculate the statistics of the CPU Utilization, Throughput, Average Waiting Time, and Average Turnaround Time.

CPU Utilization = sum of burst time/( sum of contextSwitch + sum of all turn)
Throughput = processes / timer
Average Waiting Time = sum of all wait / processes
Average Turnaround Time = sun of all turn / processes
3.	Compare pros and cons of different CPU scheduling algorithms.
